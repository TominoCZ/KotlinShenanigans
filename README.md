# __Kotlin Shenanigans__
My first time messing around with Kotlin.

This repo contains two classes I wrote to get familiar with the language's syntax and some other fun stuff like extension methods.

## __Vector__
- It's what you would expect, just a bunch of numbers we think about differently.
- This class doesn't limit how many dimensions/axes this vector can have. It is multidimensional.

## __Complex__
- A very basic implementation of a Complex number with extra features and with overloaded math operators, just like the ``Vector`` class
